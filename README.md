### Hush
Trying to learn c so here is a hashtable implementation.

Yesterday I experienced my first segfault when I tried to set a value to a 
pointer without allocating memory first. It was really intriguing.
I am compelled to make more segfaults in the future. (Of course, only the ones 
made unintentionally are interesting :)
